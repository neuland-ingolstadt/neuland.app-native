We use the **Husky** git hook to automatically fix commits according to ESLint rules and format them using Prettier.
But you can also run these commands manually:

-   `yarn lint` to check for linting errors
-   `yarn lint:fix` to automatically fix linting errors
-   `yarn format` to format the code using Prettier
