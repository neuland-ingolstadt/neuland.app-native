An open source, mobile app developed using React Native, serving as a replacement for the official Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI) app.
It features a modern user interface and utilizes the Expo framework for easy development and deployment.

## About

### App

The app aims at implementing all important features of the official app as free and open source software with a modern UI and native features.
To achieve this, the existing React backend was adapted and the Neuland GraphQL API was created.
