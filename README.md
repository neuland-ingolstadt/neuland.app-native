# neuland.app - native

An open source, mobile app developed using React Native and Expo, serving as a replacement for the official Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (THI) app.
It features a modern user interface and utilizes the Expo framework for easy development and deployment.

## About

### App

The app aims at implementing all important features of the official app as free and open source software with a modern UI and native features.
To achieve this, the existing React backend is adapted and the API of the neuland.app is used.

### Contributing

We are always looking for contributors to help us improve the app.
Check out the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

### Current State

> **Warning**
> The app is in early development and not yet publicly available.

We are currently doing an internal alpha test with the goal of releasing the app for iOS and Android later this year.
