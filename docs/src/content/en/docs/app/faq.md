# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is it secure to use Neuland Next?

Of course! We take security very seriously.
Neuland Next is built with the latest technologies and follows best practices for security and privacy.
We do not store any personal data on our servers. All data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.

### How does the app access my data?

To communicate with the university servers, we use the official THI API, which is also used by the official app.
This ensures that your data is always transmitted securely.
All communication is done only between your device and the university servers and is not routed through our servers.

### What happens to my login credentials?

To access your data, you need to log in with your THI credentials.
Your credentials are stored securely on your device and are not shared with us or any third parties.

On iOS, your credentials are stored in the secure keychain, and on Android, they are encrypted with the Android Keystore.
This allows you to access your data without having to log in every time.

### Can I check the source code?

Yes, you can! Neuland Next is and always will be open-source. You can find the full source code on [GitHub](https://https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-native).

## Are you commissioned by the THI?

No, we are not affiliated with the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt or commissioned to develop the app.
Neuland Ingolstadt e.V. is a non-profit organization founded by students of the THI. We are independent of the university and develop the app in our free time.
The university is aware of our project and gives us access to the official API to communicate with the university servers.

## What is the difference to neuland.app?

Neuland Next is the successor of the original web app neuland.app.

We have completely rewritten the app from scratch to provide a better user experience and more features.
If you still need a web app, you can use our Neuland Next web app at [web.neuland.app](https://web.neuland.app).

## Is Neuland Next free?

Yes, Neuland Next is free to use. We do not charge any fees for using the app, nor do we display ads or sell your data.

We are a non-profit organization and develop the app without any profit motive.

## Do you collect any data?

We never collect any personal data from our users. We do not store any personal information on our servers. All data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.

Usage data is collected anonymously to help us improve the app and fix bugs.
It is not linked to any personal information, so it cannot be used to identify you.
Opt-out of analytics is available in the app settings.

You can find more information about our privacy policy in our [privacy policy](/en/legal/privacy.md).

## How often is the app updated?

We release updates regularly to introduce new features, fix bugs, and ensure compatibility with university systems. Major updates are announced in the app or on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/neuland-ingolstadt/neuland.app-native).

## Does Neuland Next work offline?

Yes! Most features of Neuland Next are designed to work offline after the initial sync. Once your data (like your timetable) is loaded, you can access it without an internet connection. Some features like updates or fetching new grades require a connection.

## Why isn't the app available on F-Droid?

As an open-source project, we aim to support as many platforms as possible. However, our app depends on sensitive credentials and the official API of THI, which aren't compatible with F-Droid’s strict security and build policies. Therefore, distributing the app through F-Droid isn't currently feasible.

## How can I view my timetable?

To display your timetable, you first need to configure it using the [THI timetable website](https://hiplan.thi.de).

To do this, go to the page, log in and create your timetable by clicking on ‘Persönlicher Studenplan’ and then on ‘Fächerauswahl’. Select your subjects and save your timetable. Once you have done this, you can see your timetable in Neuland Next.

## Can I contribute to Neuland Next?

Yes, you can! Neuland Next is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you are a developer, designer, or student, you can help us improve the app and make it better for everyone.
